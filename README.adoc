= Vulkan^(R)^ API Documentation Project - default branch MOVED 2020-08-29

This README is from the 'master' branch of this project. Prior to
2020-08-29, this was the default branch for the currently published Vulkan
Specification. Going foward, the default branch is 'main', and we do not
expect to make additional commits to 'master'.

If you are a downstream consumer relying on pulling content from this
repository, please change your mirroring or pulling to refer to 'main'
branch. 'master' branch will quickly get out of date, although we are
retaining it in the hope of not breaking downstream consumers we don't know
about.

This warning note replaces the original README for this branch, which can
still be found at earlier commits to this branch.
